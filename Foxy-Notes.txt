#game start
#Tooltip saying "we can't read shit of this book, but we can try to make sense of it"
#Situation starts, base monthly progress
#On first sacrifice
#X amount of pops reanimate with 3rd lvl "zombie/negative" trait
#"Well that did not work as intended, we must keep experimenting"
#Situation will have N number of stages
#Either fixed progression where once the X amount doubles ( so like if initially only 25% of pops reanimate, make it then 50%, then 75%, DO NOT MAKE IT TILL 100% unless you don't do the enlist option) , or the "zombie/negative" trait lvl is reduced till lvl 1
#(if you want to overdo, give the option each checkpoint to choose if to make the rite more efficient on quantity or quality, if someone goes all the quality/quantity upgrades first, force the remaining one in the last checkpoints, optional , you can make them fixed alternating rewards between quantity and quality if the making them choose requires too much work)
#on situation end
#"We finished the book and discovered who it belongs to / who was the teacher of this prick" "Charting course to THE GRAND REANIMATOR"
#Spawn system with big boss dude
#On big boss dude defeated OPTIONAL give option to A kill and get relic, B Enlist legendary paragon and upgrade to final tier both quantity and quality of reanimated sacrifices (100% reanimated sacrifices, trait gives small bonuses based on "not fearing death itself" instead of any malus)
