ssp_dig_site.10.desc:0 "We have landed on the planet, research suggests that this planet has rich biodiversity. The ocean floor is full of metal wrecks along with flora that does not appear on any planet we have seen before. Scans suggest that this has come from the extended exposure to the reactor of the crashed ship. Further research is advised. "

ssp_dig_site.11.name:0 "The Mysterious Wreckage"
ssp_dig_site.11.desc:0 "After traversing and scanning the flora and fauna we finally came apun the ship mentioned in the transmission. Signs show that this ship is more than 1000 years old, which would indicate it served during the Crisis of Kangs era."

ssp_dig_site.13.name:0 "Nuclear Meltdown"
ssp_dig_site.13.desc:0 "We may have unsetteled something in the ship, the reactor leak has grown bigger and we are under constant attack from the nearby fauna, we need to make a decision now. We found a robot specimen infected with something, we believe it to be the cause of the death. Alternatively the drive core of the ship. it's more advanced than ours and in is still in perfect state, these jonans knew what they were doing. "
